# HNS Libraries

HNS support is available in many popular languages. If you know of a library that is not listed here, please [send us a PR](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens/compare).

### Javascript

* [ensjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/ensjs), maintained by the HNS developers
* [ethereum-ens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-ens) \(deprecated\)
* [react-ens-address](https://github.com/ensdomains/react-ens-address)
* [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)
* [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-ens.html)
* [embark.io](https://framework.embarklabs.io/docs/naming_configuration.html)
* [waffle.io](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens.html)

#### Which Javascript library should I use?

If you are already using web3.js or ethers.js, and do not require functionality such as creating subdomains, transferring ownership, or updating resolvers, use built in HNS features of these libraries.

If you are using React and only need to do forward and reverse resolution of HNS names with built in UI, use react-ens-address.

If you want to have HNS instance deployed into your dev environment, you may want to use embark.io or waffle.io which allows you to configure/deploy HNS registry in your Ethereum test instance.

Otherwise, use ensjs.

#### Accessing smart contracts directly

All the HNS smart contracts are published as `@ensdomains/ens-contracts` [npm module.](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts)

This is how you include abi into your frontend code.

```text
import {
  ENS,
  PublicResolver
} from '@ensdomains/ens-contracts'`
```

This is how you import our smartcontract within Solidity.

```text
import '@ensdomains/ens-contracts/contracts/registry/ENS.sol';
```
